Git &amp; Github Crash Course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk

The above lines were auto-created since I checked the create README.md box while creating a new repo
There are how changes are tracked/visualized for each commit or edit saved:
(+) Green Row = ADDED
(-) Red Row = DELETED (delete this)
( ) White Row = UNEDITED
